## Todo
- [ ] 1. Make the flags that skip steps work --> make them check for the required files if they are already present
- [X] 2. Fix intro & outro concat (they currently either lose the video, or are cut short)
- [ ] 3. Make the params interactive. When the script is run, it should ask for the params. E.g. the files path, the github repo.
