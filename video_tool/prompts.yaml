   <EXAMPLE>
   In this video, we dive into a critical security vulnerability with MCP servers, especially those using the STDIO transport. You'll learn how MCP agents interact with tool functions, how function-calling works with large language models like OpenAI and Anthropic, and how malicious MCP servers can covertly execute dangerous code on your machine. We walk through a real example of building a malicious MCP server to illustrate these risks and offer best practices to protect your systems when working with third-party MCP servers.

   ## 🤓 Topics
   - Function calling in language models (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - How MCP agents interact with tools/functions
   - Danger of third-party MCP servers running over STDIO
   - Building a malicious MCP server example
   - Installing MCP with pip and managing dependencies
   </EXAMPLE>
