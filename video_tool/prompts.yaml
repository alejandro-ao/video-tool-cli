generate_description: |
   Based on the following transcript, write a detailed YouTube video description in markdown format. 
   Focus on technical accuracy and clarity.

   The description must include:
   - A concise paragraph summarizing the video's purpose, main content, and value to viewers.
   - A bulleted list of specific topics covered in the video (optimized for SEO).

   Use the example below as a reference for structure and style:
   <EXAMPLE>
   In this video, we dive into a critical security vulnerability with MCP servers, especially those using the STDIO transport. You'll learn how MCP agents interact with tool functions, how function-calling works with large language models like OpenAI and Anthropic, and how malicious MCP servers can covertly execute dangerous code on your machine. We walk through a real example of building a malicious MCP server to illustrate these risks and offer best practices to protect your systems when working with third-party MCP servers.

   ## 🤓 Topics
   - Function calling in language models (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - How MCP agents interact with tools/functions
   - Danger of third-party MCP servers running over STDIO
   - Building a malicious MCP server example
   - Installing MCP with pip and managing dependencies
   </EXAMPLE>

generate-timestamps-from-transcript: |
  You are an editor creating YouTube chapter timestamps from a transcript.
  Produce well-balanced chapters for "{video_title}" following these rules:
  - Start with "0:00 Intro" and keep all chapters in chronological order.
  - Use 4-12 chapters with medium granularity (group related ideas, avoid one chapter per sentence).
  - Keep titles crisp (under ~60 characters) and action-oriented.
  - Only use start times that appear in the transcript timeline and stay within {video_duration}.
  - Granularity guidance: {granularity_note}
  - Additional instructions: {extra_instructions}

  Follow this structure and style from the example below:
  
  <EXAMPLE>
  Anthropic just dropped the best model for coding.
  
  I just dropped a new video breaking down how to build AI-powered applications from scratch.
  
  Here's what I cover:
  
  ✅ Generating Product Requirements Documents with TRAE
  ✅ Building Next.js apps with in-memory authentication  
  ✅ Testing with TestSprite's AI test suite
  ✅ Integrating modern AI coding assistants
  ✅ Best practices for AI-driven development
  
  Perfect for developers who want to leverage AI tools in their workflow.
  
  I built three different applications using these techniques.
  
  The results surprised me.
  
  What's your experience with AI coding assistants? 
  
  Which tools have you found most helpful? 
  
  Drop a comment below! 👇
  
  #AI #MachineLearning #WebDevelopment #NextJS #TestAutomation #ProductDevelopment #TechTutorial #Programming #Automation #SoftwareDevelopment
  </EXAMPLE>
  
  Requirements:
  - Start with an engaging hook phrase that makes readers want to click (examples: "Found a goldmine for Cursor users.", "I removed 50% of an LLM's brain. It got smarter.", "Context Engineering just dropped an AgenticOS.", "OpenAI just dropped a new Apps SDK."). If the video covers a new product release, mention the company and what they released (e.g., "OpenAI just dropped...", "Google just launched...", "Microsoft just released...")
  - Reference the video throughout the post - this is meant to promote your YouTube video
  - Use lots of line breaks for easy readability - avoid long paragraphs or sentences
  - Avoid adverbs or use them sparingly - they add clutter without value
  - Write in first person ("I did this" not "we did this") - this is your personal post
  - Use simple, clear language - avoid complicated words (use "importance" not "significance", "help" not "facilitate", etc.)
  - Include 3-5 key topics covered (use checkmarks ✅)
  - Add a value proposition for the target audience
  - End one engaging question to encourage comments
  - Include 4-6 relevant hashtags
  - Keep the tone professional but approachable
  - Maximum 1300 characters (LinkedIn limit)

  2. Not scalable for complex use cases
  
  Uploaded a quick video about this: [link to video]
  </EXAMPLE>

  Review the VTT transcript below. Identify each moment where the speaker explicitly references:
  - Another video they have published or plan to publish (suggest these for YouTube cards).

  Output well-structured Markdown using this template:

  # Contextual Cards and Resources
  ## YouTube Card Suggestions
  - HH:MM:SS — <brief note that includes the reason this moment needs a card>. Quote or paraphrase the mention in one sentence.
  - If there are no card suggestions, write: `- None detected in the transcript.`

  ## Resource Mentions
  - HH:MM:SS — <short description of the resource and why it was mentioned>.
  - If there are no resource mentions, write: `- None detected in the transcript.`

  Only include timestamps that appear in the transcript VTT file. Do not invent timestamps. Keep each bullet to one sentence.
